# aboutKennyYang Website

## What the project is 
##### In this project we were given the task of creating a mini portfolio/resume of ourselves.
##### We were to create 3 pages consisting of our index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html each with their own unique content

### index.html
##### Here we created a short description of us and also attached an image of us as well. 

### portfolio.html
##### Here we created a cards that would hyperlink to our Github, LinkedIn, and Facebook accounts. 

### contact.html
##### Here we created a contact page where users are able to send us their full name email address and a message they would like to relay to us. 

## What we used

### Bootstrap
##### We were required to use Bootstrap's unique grid systems to layout our html files. Also using Bootstrap's design, we were also able to "mobile first" our applications which made it responsive to both small scale and large scale displays. 


### Semantic Elements
##### As was required of our last homework assignment, we needed to rename the <div> tags and replace them with unique html semantic elements

### Github
##### We were also told to use Github to deploy our application. You can [Click Here](https://github.com/Kennsters/aboutKennyYang) under the 'aboutKennyYang' repo to learn more about the code itself.
